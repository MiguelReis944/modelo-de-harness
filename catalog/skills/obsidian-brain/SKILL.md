# Obsidian Brain — LLM Wiki Setup Skill

Scaffolds an Obsidian vault (or extends an existing one) as a persistent, LLM-maintained
knowledge base following the LLM Wiki pattern. The LLM writes and maintains the wiki — you
curate sources, direct analysis, and ask questions. The tedious bookkeeping (cross-references,
summaries, contradiction tracking, index maintenance) is the LLM's job.

## Architecture

Three layers, always:

| Layer | Owner | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Raw sources** (`raw/`) | Human | Immutable. Articles, PDFs, specs, meeting notes. LLM reads, never modifies. |
| **Wiki** (`wiki/`) | LLM | Compiled knowledge. Summaries, entity pages, concept pages, comparisons. LLM creates, updates, cross-references. |
| **Schema** (`AGENTS.md` + `_meta/`) | Co-evolved | Conventions, taxonomy, sub-skills. Tells the LLM how to operate on this vault. |

## Wizard Flow

When this skill is invoked, gather these inputs before scaffolding:

### Step 1 — Detect context

```
Is there an existing vault?
  → Ask: "What's the path to your Obsidian vault?"
  → Check if AGENTS.md and _meta/ already exist at that path

No vault yet?
  → Ask: "Where should I create the vault? (path)"
```

### Step 2 — Project details

Ask these one at a time:

1. **Project name** — kebab-case identifier (e.g., `consulta-saldo-cartao`)
2. **Domain** — one of:
   - `research` — papers, articles, evolving thesis
   - `business` — meeting notes, decisions, business rules, API specs
   - `personal` — goals, journal, self-improvement
   - `engineering` — codebase docs, architecture decisions, incident reports
3. **Short description** — one line describing the project's purpose

### Step 3 — Scaffold

Generate the full structure. If the vault already exists, only add the new project under
`projects/` and update the global `index.md`. Never overwrite existing files.

## Generated Structure

### New vault (first project)

```
<vault-path>/
├── AGENTS.md                    # Schema — how agents operate on this vault
├── _meta/
│   ├── skills/                  # Operational sub-skills (8 total)

└── log.md                       # Global activity timeline
```

### Adding to existing vault

Only create:
- `projects/<project-name>/` with full sub-structure
- Update global `index.md` with new project entry
- Append to global `log.md`

## File Templates

### Global `index.md`

```markdown
# Knowledge Base

Central hub for all projects in this vault.

## Projects

| Project | Domain | Description | Pages | Last Updated |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| [[projects/<name>/index\|<name>]] | <domain> | <description> | 0 | <date> |
```

### Global `log.md`

```markdown
# Activity Log

Append-only record of all operations across the vault.

## [<date>] setup | <project-name>
- Created project structure
- Domain: <domain>
- Description: <description>
```

### Project `index.md`

```markdown
# <Project Name>

> <description>

## AGENTS.md Generation

Read the template from `references/agents-template.md` and customize it:

1. Replace `{{vault-path}}` with the actual vault path
2. Replace `{{projects-list}}` with the current project table
3. Adapt the "Operations" section emphasis based on domain:
   - **business**: emphasize ingest (specs, meeting notes) and query (business rules lookup)
   - **research**: emphasize ingest (papers) and query (thesis-driven synthesis)
   - **engineering**: emphasize ingest (code docs, ADRs) and lint (consistency checks)
   - **personal**: emphasize ingest (journal, articles) and cross-link (pattern discovery)

## Sub-Skills Installation

Copy each sub-skill template from `references/` into `_meta/skills/` within the vault.
These are **not templates to customize** — they are the actual operational skills that the
agent will read and follow. They work as-is for any domain.

Read each from:
- `references/ingest.md` → `_meta/skills/ingest.md`
- `references/query.md` → `_meta/skills/query.md`
- `references/lint.md` → `_meta/skills/lint.md`
- `references/cross-link.md` → `_meta/skills/cross-link.md`
- `references/status.md` → `_meta/skills/status.md`
- `references/export.md` → `_meta/skills/export.md`
- `references/context.md` → `_meta/skills/context.md`
- `references/bridge.md` → `_meta/skills/bridge.md`

## Post-Setup Checklist

After scaffolding, verify:

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` exists at vault root and references all 8 skills
- [ ] `_meta/skills/` contains all 8 `.md` files (ingest, query, lint, cross-link, status, export, context, bridge)
- [ ] `_meta/taxonomy.md` matches the chosen domain (includes Relation Types section)
- [ ] `projects/<name>/` has `_context.md`, `raw/`, `wiki/` (with subdirs), `output/`, `index.md`, `log.md`
- [ ] Global `index.md` lists the new project
- [ ] Global `log.md` has the setup entry
- [ ] No existing files were overwritten
- [ ] `_context.md` was generated for the new project (even if minimal for a fresh project)

Then tell the user:

> "Vault configurado. Para começar, drop seus primeiros arquivos em
> `projects/<name>/raw/` e peça para o agent fazer o ingest. O AGENTS.md
> já ensina qualquer agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.)
> a operar nesse vault."

## Tips for the User

- **Obsidian Web Clipper**: browser extension that converts articles to markdown — drop into `raw/`
- **Graph View**: use Obsidian's graph view to see connections between pages
- **Dataview plugin**: if the LLM adds YAML frontmatter, Dataview generates dynamic tables
- **Git**: the vault is just markdown files — version control with git for free
- **One source at a time**: for best results, ingest sources individually and stay involved
